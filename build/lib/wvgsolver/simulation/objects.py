    Parameters
    ----------

      The range of frequencies to perform the frequency analysis over, with the number of data points with

    run_time : float
      The run time of the simulation in seconds. The analysis is performed upon completion of this time
    window_pos : float
      A float between 0 and 1 indicating where to place the simulation window within the two stacked copies
      of the unit cell. A value of 0 means make the simulation window overlap exactly with the first copy, then
      as we increase it to 0.5 we move the window to be centered between the two copies, and then moving it to 1
      makes it overlap exactly with the second cell.
    TEonly : bool
      Whether or not to enforce TE only modes by applying an antisymmetric boundary condition along the y-axis.
    ndipoles : int
      The number of dipoles to use to generate the initial pulse
    dipole_region : Vec3 or float
      The size of the region within which the source dipoles are randomly placed, in relative units to the
      unit cell's size. For example, a value of Vec3(0.5, 0.2, 0.3) means the dipoles will be placed in a box sized
      0.5*x, 0.2*y, 0.3*z centered at the origin of the window, where x, y, and z are the dimensions of the unit cell.
      A single float value corresponds to a vector whose all three elements are equal to that value.
    dipole_directions : Vec3
      This indicates the relative weights of the three dimensions that the dipole axes can point along. Each dipole starts
      with a randomly chosen axis, and we multiply by dipole_directions to get the final axis. So if you wanted to force all
      dipoles to lie along the y-axis, you could provide Vec3(0, 1, 0)
    sim_size : Vec3 or float
      The size of the simulation region in the y and z dimensions (along the x dimension, it's equal to the x dimension of the unit
      cell because that's the dimension of periodicity), in units of the size of the unit cell. The x component of this vector is ignored, 
      so a value of Vec3(0, 1.5, 2) would correspond to a simulation region 1.5 times as large as the y-dimension of the unit cell
      in the y dimension, and 2 times as large as the z-dimension of the unit cell in the z dimension. A single float value 
      corresponds to a vector whose all three elements are equal to that value.
    analyze_region : Vec3 or float
      The size of the region within which frequency domain data will be gathered at a series of random points, in units
      of the size of the unit cell. A single float value corresponds to a vector whose all three elements are equal to that value.
